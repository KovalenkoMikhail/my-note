🧪 JUnit 5: A Tool for Your Tests
JUnit is a tool for writing and running tests for your Java code. It helps you find problems fast.

Important Words and Symbols
Key Annotations
Annotations are special words that start with @. They tell JUnit what to do.

@Test: This says, "This is a test method."

@BeforeEach: This runs a method before every test. It is good for preparing things, like your Calculator for testing.

@DisplayName: This gives your test a name. It helps you read test reports easily.

Assertion Methods
Assertions are like checks. They help you see if your code is correct.

assertEquals(): Checks if two things are the same.

assertThrows(): Checks if your code gives an error. For example, if you divide a number by zero.

assertTrue(), assertFalse(): Checks if something is true or false.

What is this () -> code?
This is a small block of code. You can use it with assertThrows(). It means "run this code and check for an error." For example, () -> calculator.divide(10, 0) tells JUnit to run the division and check for a problem.
